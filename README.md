# AP Exam Score

## Data

### The Tables 

#### AP Scores Table

Broken down into individual tables. These are the following:

Example of a table is: 

#### Last Years Scores Table

#### This Years Scores Table

## Goal
At EMKS, students in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade enroll in AP courses. Students take internally-developed interim assessments throughout the year that are aligned to the courses’ respective official AP exam. The scores on interim assessments lead to a “Predicted Score.” Predicted Scores are then used to support students in deciding whether or not they should take the official AP exam at the end of the school year. 

## Questiona
- What number of students are passing against the number tested? On what exams are we seeing our highest/lowest pass rates? 
- How did our pass rates this year compare to our pass rates last year, and what headlines should we take away from that data? 
- How did we perform on this year’s participation goals against this year’s actual participation rates? 
- How did we perform on this year’s index goals against this year’s actual index rates? 
- What correlating trends would you extract for investigation further or prioritize based on your aggregation of the data? 

## Additonal Details

- A passing AP score is a score of AP3 or higher
- The AP Index is cauclated as the participation rate*pass rate
- Participation Rate = number of students who tested in a given AP content/total number of students in the grade level
- Pass rate = number of students who passed the test in a given AP content/total number of students who tested
