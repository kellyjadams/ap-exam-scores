Below is an example of the AP Language table. 

| Student Identifier | Grade | Cohort     | AP Lang Predicted AP Score           | AP Lang Predicted AP Level | Did Student Test? | AP Lang Actual AP Score | AP Lang - Actual AP Level |
|--------------------|-------|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Student 1          | 11    | Georgetown | Not Projected AP3+ (Off Track = AP1) | Below AP3                  | Yes               | 2                       | Below AP3                 |
| Student 2          | 11    | Notre Dame | Not Projected AP3+ (Off Track = AP1) | Below AP3                  | Yes               | 2                       | Below AP3                 |
| Student 3          | 11    | Georgetown | On Track to AP3                      | AP3 or Above               | No                | No Score                | No Score                  |
| Student 4          | 11    | Notre Dame | Not Projected AP3+ (Off Track = AP1) | Below AP3                  | Yes               | 3                       | AP3 or Above              |
| Student 5          | 11    | Notre Dame | On Track to AP4+                     | AP3 or Above               | No                | No Score                | No Score                  |
Here is a data dictionary of the values:
- Student Identifier: The student ID
- Grade: The grade level of the student, for this dataset the grades are 10-12.
- Cohort: Which college the student would like to go to
- AP (Subject) Predicted Score: The predicted score based off of previous AP assessments. An AP score can be between 1-5.
- AP (Subject) Predicted AP Level: The predicted level based off of previous AP assessments. A student passes if they get a score of 3 or above, a fail if they get a 2 or below. 
- Did Student Test?: Yes or No
- AP (Subject) Actual AP Score: The actual score the student recieved if they took the AP exam, the score can be between 1-5. If they did not then it's a "No Score".
- AP (Subject) - Actual AP Level: The actual level of the student based off of the score they recieved during the AP Exam. If a student gets a score of 3 or above, it reads "AP3 or Above", if it's a score of 2 or below then it's "Below AP3", and if a student did not test then it is "No Score".

#### This Years Scores Table

## Goal
At EMKS, students in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade enroll in AP courses. Students take internally-developed interim assessments throughout the year that are aligned to the courses’ respective official AP exam. The scores on interim assessments lead to a “Predicted Score.” Predicted Scores are then used to support students in deciding whether or not they should take the official AP exam at the end of the school year. 

## Questiona
- What number of students are passing against the number tested? On what exams are we seeing our highest/lowest pass rates? 
- How did our pass rates this year compare to our pass rates last year, and what headlines should we take away from that data? 
- How did we perform on this year’s participation goals against this year’s actual participation rates? 
- How did we perform on this year’s index goals against this year’s actual index rates? 
- What correlating trends would you extract for investigation further or prioritize based on your aggregation of the data? 

## Additonal Details

- A passing AP score is a score of AP3 or higher
- The AP Index is cauclated as the participation rate*pass rate
- Participation Rate = number of students who tested in a given AP content/total number of students in the grade level
- Pass rate = number of students who passed the test in a given AP content/total number of students who tested
